# Logged On USer

A simple Windows C++ application to test the ```NetWkstaUserEnum``` function that I will put in the Recon server app. 
Because it is a service running on a System account, I needed a way to list the currently logged on users while on an service account.

I might use the Dialog resource as well.

The client broadcast the current computer information and the user is part of that.
